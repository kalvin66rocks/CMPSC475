    <string name="history_content">As it turns out, the game almost didn\'t happen. In 1991, Wizards of the Coast was busy printing roleplaying games and supplements, and operated out of Peter Adkison\’s basement. Adkison was the owner and CEO of Wizards when he was approached by Dr. Richard Garfield, a doctoral candidate in combinatorial mathematics. Garfield was interested in having Wizards publish his “RoboRally” board game design. Adkison liked RoboRally (and would later produce it through Wizards) but he felt at the time that Wizards didn’t possess the resources or technical know-how to produce a board game. He asked Garfield to instead come up with a simple game that could be played in minutes, and that was portable enough that people could play it while “waiting in line at conventions.” Garfield went back to his workshop and emerged with the very first version of the game we now know as Magic.</string>

    <string name="legacy_answer">Close, Legacy is the second oldest format that is still played. Any card printed in Magic\'s history can be played in Legacy, except for cards that have proven to be too powerful for the format and thus been placed on the ban list. Many people still enjoy playing this to this day. </string>
    <string name="modern_answer">Modern is actually the newest sanctioned magic format. Modern was established as a way to create a new non rotating format inbetween Legacy and Extended. Any card printed from 8th edition and onward is legal, except for those cards that have proven to be too powerful and been place on the ban list.</string>
    <string name="standard_answer">While not the newest format in Magic\'s history, Standard is a rotating format that is always using the newest cards that have been printed. Standard, unlike the other formats rarely bans cards, as cards rotate out of the format whenever newer cards are printed. There have been rare occasions where standard bans have been necessary, but they are few and far between\</string>
    <string name="limited_answer">While, one of the older magic formats, limited is actually unqiue in that prior to playing in a limited event you do not have a deck. Limited events are played by opening a number of magic packs, then using the contents from across thos poacks to build a 40 card deck. You then use this to take on other limited decks.</string>
